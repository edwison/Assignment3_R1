## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r lib , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)

```


```{r male, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
surveys_data <-read.csv('surveys.csv')
DM_data <- filter(surveys_data, species_id == 'DM',sex != '',!is.na(weight),!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>% select(sex,hindfoot_length,weight)

DM_male <- filter(DM_data, sex == 'M')
DM_female <- filter(DM_data, sex == 'F')

ggscatter(DM_male, x = "hindfoot_length", y = "weight",title = "Relationship between weight and hindfoot_length", xlab = "Hindfoot_length(mm)", ylab = "weight(gm)",
          add = "reg.line",  # Add regressin line
          add.params = list(color = "blue", fill = "lightgray"), # Customize reg. line
          conf.int = TRUE ) + stat_cor(method = "pearson", label.x = 20, label.y = 200)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
